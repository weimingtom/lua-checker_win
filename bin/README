This flex is built for the purpose of building Postgres on Windows.

It is accompanied by a cygwin1.dll which is needed to run it. 

The licenses for flex and cygwin are also present. To comply with the
license that applies to cygwin, the source code for building the DLL is
available at the same place the zip file containing these binaries, on the
Postgres ftp site and mirrors.

To run this version of flex, you will need to set the M4 environment variable
to point to your installation of m4. You need one of these in order to run
both bison and flex, and it sometimes comes packaged with bison.

If you are using this in a buildfarm member, you can set that environment
variable in its config file, in the build_env stanza, something like:

	M4 => 'c:\path\to\bin\m4.exe',
